/**
 * This is a filter for the RunLength Decoder.
 * 
 * From the PDF Reference 
 * <pre>
 * The RunLengthDecode filter decodes data that has been encoded in a simple
 * byte-oriented format based on run length. The encoded data is a sequence of
 * runs, where each run consists of a length byte followed by 1 to 128 bytes of data. If
 * the length byte is in the range 0 to 127, the following length + 1 (1 to 128) bytes
 * are copied literally during decompression. If length is in the range 129 to 255, the
 * following single byte is to be copied 257 ? length (2 to 128) times during decompression.
 * A length value of 128 denotes EOD.
 * 
 * The compression achieved by run-length encoding depends on the input data. In
 * the best case (all zeros), a compression of approximately 64:1 is achieved for long
 * files. The worst case (the hexadecimal sequence 00 alternating with FF) results in
 * an expansion of 127:128.
 * </pre>
