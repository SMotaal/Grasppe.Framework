/**
 * This class represents the protection policy to use to protect 
 * a document with the public key security handler as described
 * in the PDF specification 1.6 p104. 
 * 
 * PDF documents are encrypted so that they can be decrypted by 
 * one or more recipients. Each recipient have its own access permission. 
 * 
 * The following code sample shows how to protect a document using
 * the public key security handler. In this code sample, <code>doc</code> is 
 * a <code>PDDocument</code> object.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * PublicKeyProtectionPolicy policy = new PublicKeyProtectionPolicy();
 * PublicKeyRecipient recip = new PublicKeyRecipient();
 * AccessPermission ap = new AccessPermission(); 
 * ap.setCanModify(false);
 * recip.setPermission(ap);
 * 
 * // load the recipient's certificate
 * InputStream inStream = new FileInputStream(certificate_path);
 * CertificateFactory cf = CertificateFactory.getInstance("X.509");
 * X509Certificate certificate = (X509Certificate)cf.generateCertificate(inStream);
 * inStream.close();
 * 
 * recip.setX509(certificate); // set the recipient's certificate
 * policy.addRecipient(recip);
 * policy.setEncryptionKeyLength(128); // the document will be encrypted with 128 bits secret key
 * doc.protect(policy);
 * doc.save(out);
 * </pre>
