		<b>Sponsor new PDFBox functionality!</b><br/>
		PDFBox is looking for a company to sponsor a Software Engineering senior project at <a href="http://www.se.rit.edu/">RIT</a>.  If you 
		are planning to use PDFBox in a new project or need new functionality to be implemented in PDFBox then this may be a great opportunity 
		for you.<br/>
		<br/>
		Projects last for 20 weeks with teams of 4-6 seniors each working ~15 hours a week.<br/>
		<br/>
		I would act as the main contact for the project so requirements on your time would be minimal.  As a sponsor your requirements would be
		<ul>
		    <li>Help define the requirements for the project</li>
		    <li>Pay for project expenses and/or make a donation to the Senior Scholarship Fund.</li>
		</ul>
		<br/>
		If you have questions or are interested in sponsoring a team then please email <a href="mailto:ben@benlitchfield.com">me</a> ASAP.
