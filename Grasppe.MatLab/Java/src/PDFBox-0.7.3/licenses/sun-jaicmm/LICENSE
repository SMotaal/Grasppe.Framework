	Java(TM) Advanced Imaging API
		 Version 1.0
	     Binary Code License

This binary code license ("License") contains
rights and restrictions associated with use of
the accompanying Java(TM) Advanced Imaging API
software and documentation ("Software"). Read the
License carefully before using the Software. By
using the Software you agree to the terms and
conditions of this License.

1.  License to Distribute. Licensee is granted a
    royalty-free right to reproduce and
    distribute the Software provided that
    Licensee:

    (A) distributes the Software complete and
	unmodified (except for the specific files
	identified as optional in the Software
	README file), only as part of, and for
	the sole purpose of running, Licensee's
	Java compatible applet or application
	("Program") into which the Software is
	incorporated;

    (B) does not distribute additional software
	intended to replace any component(s) of
	the Software;

    (C) agrees to incorporate the most current
	version of the Software that was
	available 180 days prior to each
	production release of the Program;

    (D) does not remove or alter any proprietary
	legends or notices contained in the
	Software;

    (E) includes the provisions of Sections 2, 3,
	5, 6, 8 and 9 in Licensee's license
	agreement for the Program; and

    (F) agrees to indemnify, hold harmless, and
	defend Sun and its licensors from and
	against any claims or lawsuits, including
	attorneys' fees, that arise or result
	from the use or distribution of the
	Program.

2.  Java Platform Interface. Licensee may not
    modify the Java Platform Interface ("JPI",
    identified as classes contained within the
    "java" package or any subpackages of the
    "java" package), by creating additional
    classes within the JPI or otherwise causing
    the addition to or modification of the
    classes in the JPI. In the event that
    Licensee creates any Java-related API and
    distributes such API to others for applet or
    application development, Licensee must
    promptly publish broadly, an accurate
    specification for such API for free use by
    all developers of Java-based software.

3.  Restrictions. Software is confidential
    copyrighted information of Sun and title to
    all copies is retained by Sun and/or its
    licensors.  Licensee shall not decompile,
    disassemble, decrypt, extract, or otherwise
    reverse engineer Software. Software may not
    be leased, assigned, or sublicensed, in whole
    or in part, except as specifically authorized
    in Section 1. Software is not designed or
    intended for use in online control of
    aircraft, air traffic, aircraft navigation or
    aircraft communications; or in the design,
    construction, operation or maintenance of any
    nuclear facility.  Licensee warrants that it
    will not use or redistribute the Software for
    such purposes.

4.  Trademarks and Logos. This License does not
    authorize Licensee to use any Sun name,
    trademark or logo. Licensee acknowledges that
    Sun owns the Java trademark and all
    Java-related trademarks, logos and icons
    including the Coffee Cup and Duke ("Java
    Marks") and agrees to:

    (A) comply with the Java Trademark Guidelines
	at http://java.sun.com/trademarks.html;

    (B) not do anything harmful to or
    inconsistent
	with Sun's rights in the Java Marks; and

    (C) assist Sun in protecting those rights,
	including assigning to Sun any rights
	acquired by Licensee in any Java Mark.

5.  Disclaimer of Warranty. Software is provided
    "AS IS," without a warranty of any kind. ALL
    EXPRESS OR IMPLIED REPRESENTATIONS AND
    WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF
    MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, ARE HEREBY
    EXCLUDED.

6.  Limitation of Liability. SUN AND ITS
LICENSORS
    SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES SUFFERED
    BY LICENSEE OR ANY THIRD PARTY AS A RESULT OF
    USING OR DISTRIBUTING SOFTWARE. IN NO EVENT
    WILL SUN OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY
    LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR DIRECT,
    INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL
    OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED AND
    REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY,
    ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE
    SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7.  Termination. This license shall automatically
    terminate 180 days after production release
    of the next version of the Software by Sun.
    Licensee may terminate this License at any
    time by destroying all copies of Software.
    This License will terminate immediately
    without notice from Sun if Licensee fails to
    comply with any provision of this License.
    Upon such termination, Licensee must destroy
    all copies of Software.

8.  Export Regulations. Software, including
    technical data, is subject to U.S. export
    control laws, including the U.S. Export
    Administration Act and its associated
    regulations, and may be subject to export or
    import regulations in other countries.
    Licensee agrees to comply strictly with all
    such regulations and acknowledges that it has
    the responsibility to obtain licenses to
    export, re-export, or import Software.
    Software may not be downloaded, or otherwise
    exported or re-exported

    (A) into, or to a national or resident of,
	Cuba, Iraq, Iran, North Korea, Libya,
	Sudan, Syria or any country to which the
	U.S.  has embargoed goods; or

    (B) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury
	Department's list of Specially Designated
	Nations or the U.S. Commerce Department's
	Table of Denial Orders.

9.  Restricted Rights. Use, duplication or
    disclosure by the United States government is
    subject to the restrictions as set forth in
    the Rights in Technical Data and Computer
    Software Clauses in DFARS 252.227-7013(c) (1)
    (ii) and FAR 52.227-19(c) (2) as applicable.

10. Governing Law. Any action related to this
    License will be governed by California law
    and controlling U.S. federal law. No choice
    of law rules of any jurisdiction will apply.

11. Severability. If any of the above provisions
    are held to be in violation of applicable
    law, void, or unenforceable in any
    jurisdiction, then such provisions are
    herewith waived or amended to the extent
    necessary for the License to be otherwise
    enforceable in such jurisdiction.  However,
    if in Sun's opinion deletion or amendment of
    any provisions of the License by operation of
    this paragraph unreasonably compromises the
    rights or increase the liabilities of Sun or
    its licensors, Sun reserves the right to
    terminate the License.
