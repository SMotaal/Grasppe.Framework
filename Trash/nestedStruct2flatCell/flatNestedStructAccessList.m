function [flatCellString, isLeafNode]= flatNestedStructAccessList(S, varargin)

% Create a string list of all possible struct access operators (e.g. x.y.z)
% from a nested structure (think of it as a tree view program, except that
% eval(..) the strings in the output display).
%
%
% It's hard to describe it in simple words. 
% Before somebody send me good documentation suggestions, please take
% a look at the screenshots at:
%
% http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/loadFile.do?objectId=
% 18816&objectType=FILE
%
%
% Usage:    flatCellString = flatStructAccessList(structure)
%           Do NOT put in extra arguments/outputs! That's for recusion only
%
% Purpose:  For accessing (flattening) big nested struct automatically with
%           eval(..). Or it can serve a a tree view for nested structure.
%
% WARNING:  This program doesn't supported nested structs with 
%           non-signleton branches (except the leaf nodes). In other words,
%           don't use it on nested structs with something like this
%
%               a.b{3}.c = 1;
%           or
%
%               p.q(4).r = 5;
%             
%           I don't know what's going to happen if you do so!
%
%           I'd appreciate if somebody can expand this to vector branches,
%           like x(1).y{2}.z
